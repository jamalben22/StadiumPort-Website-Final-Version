During the tournament, FIFA will refer to the venue as "New York New Jersey Stadium" due to sponsorship policies. The stadium underwent significant renovations specifically for the World Cup.

New York's three major airports make this one of the most accessible World Cup destinations globally:

- John F. Kennedy International (JFK): The primary international gateway, about 26 miles from MetLife Stadium 
- Newark Liberty International (EWR): The closest major airport, approximately 15-20 miles from the stadium 
- LaGuardia (LGA): Mainly domestic flights, about 18 miles from the stadium 

All three airports connect to Manhattan via various options, where you can then catch direct transit to MetLife Stadium.

Direct Stadium Access: The Smart Way

The Best Option: NJ Transit Train

The fastest and most cost-effective route is taking an NJ Transit train from Penn Station New York (located at 32nd Street between 7th and 8th Avenues) to Secaucus Junction, then transferring to a shuttle train directly to Meadowlands Rail Station. For large events, NJ Transit offers special train service from Secaucus Junction directly to Meadowlands Rail Station, just steps away from MetLife Stadium. 

The entire journey takes roughly 30 minutes from Midtown Manhattan, and trains run frequently on match days. NJ Transit operates the Meadowlands Rail Service for events with anticipated attendance above 50,000, delivering guests directly to the front door of MetLife Stadium. 

Budget-Friendly Bus Option 

The Coach USA 351 Meadowlands Express provides door-to-door round-trip transportation from the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York City to MetLife Sports Complex. Bus service begins three hours prior to event start time, making it perfect for pre-match atmosphere-building. 

Pro Traveler Tip: Book your NJ Transit tickets through their mobile app ahead of time.
